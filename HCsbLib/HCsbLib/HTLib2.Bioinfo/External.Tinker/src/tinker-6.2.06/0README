                   ------------------------------------------
                   Fortran Source Code for the TINKER Package
                   ------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains the Fortran 95 source code for the
         current version of the TINKER program package.

         The code is in a standard Fortran dialect that should compile
         unchanged on most machines. Script files to build the package
         on a variety of systems are in subdirectories named for the
         machine/operating system.

         Only a few source files may require editing prior to building:
         "sizes.i" which contains the master array dimensions used
         throughout the package, and "openend.f" which is a system
         dependent routine to open a file at the end.

         In addition, if your system does not support the iargc/getarg
         mechanism for command line arguments, then comment out the
         call to the subroutine "command" at the bottom of the source
         file "initial.f".

         If you are building an OpenMP-capable version of TINKER with
         a compiler other than the Intel Fortran compiler, then it may
         be necessary remove the calls to the Intel-specific extensions
         "kmp_set_stacksize" and "kmp-set-blocksize" near the top of the
         file "initial.f".
